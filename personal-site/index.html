        <main>
          <p>Hello World!</p>
          <p>
            I'm Jason, an experienced IT professional based in York,
            Pennsylvania. With over eight years in Information Technology and
            sixteen years in the financial services industry, I specialize in
            designing and implementing technology solutions that drive
            organizational value and efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my current role as head of the Digital Solutions Division at
            Patriot FCU, I lead a team focused on developing innovative digital
            solutions to streamline internal processes and enhance operational
            efficiency. We handle the full lifecycle of digital transformation
            projects, strengthening our organization’s technological
            infrastructure and supporting seamless, secure operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work leverages the Microsoft 365 platform, where I use tools like
            Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint to build efficient
            low-code solutions. I also oversee integrations with enterprise
            software from vendors like Adobe and DocuSign, ensuring a cohesive
            digital ecosystem across the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey into software development began in 2014 at DVLUP Day in
            New York City. Since then, I've been captivated by the endless
            possibilities coding offers. While I focus on low-code development
            professionally, I’m constantly learning and experimenting with new
            technologies to expand my skill set.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a personal note, I'm a devoted Christian, husband, and father.
            Outside of work, I enjoy staying current with technology trends,
            spending quality time with my family, taking beach trips, reading,
            and kicking around a soccer ball.
          </p>
          <p>
