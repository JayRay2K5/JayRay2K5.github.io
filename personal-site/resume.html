              This Page Feedback Web Part is developed using TypeScript, CSS
              Modules, and the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) to gather user
              feedback on SharePoint pages. Users can provide feedback through
              Like, Dislike, or Neutral responses, with a text box for

              This project represents my initial foray into web development.
              Using HTML and CSS, I focused on applying core design principles
              such as the box model, Flexbox, Grid, and typography. This serves
              as a practical demonstration of my understanding of responsive
              design and layout techniques, reflecting my approach to blending
              foundational skills with modern web standards.

              In this role, I spearhead the development of innovative solutions
              aimed at streamlining internal processes and boosting
              organizational efficiency. From conceptualization to execution, I
              drive the transformation of our digital landscape, ensuring
              seamless operations and fostering technological advancements
              within the organization.
            </p>
            <p>Key Contributions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Orchestrated the design and implementation of a cutting-edge
                SharePoint intranet, alongside automated workflows and low-code
                solutions. This initiative facilitated a smooth transition from
                the outdated intranet, empowering our teams with a more
                intuitive and collaborative platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pioneered the creation of bespoke Power Apps tailored to our
                specific needs, revolutionizing systems such as employee forums
                and recognition programs. These custom applications not only
                replaced outdated tools but also enhanced user experience and
                engagement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Engineered automated workflows for critical processes such as
                Policy & Guideline review, announcements, and organizational
                news notifications. By automating these workflows, we
                significantly reduced manual workload and mitigated the risk of
                errors, ultimately fostering a more efficient and
                error-resistant environment.
